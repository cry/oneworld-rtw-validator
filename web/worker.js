/* The validator, running in a worker.
 *
 * vendor/swipl-bundle-no-data.js is SWI-Prolog compiled to WebAssembly, and
 * rtw.pvm is this repository's Prolog compiled into an image it can boot from.
 * `npm run wasm` builds both. What runs here is the same rules the HTTP service
 * runs, not a translation of them, and that is the whole reason for going this
 * way round instead of reimplementing the fare in JavaScript.
 *
 * This is a worker rather than main-thread code for two reasons. Compiling
 * 2.5 MB of WebAssembly blocks whatever thread it happens on. And Prolog queries
 * here are synchronous, with no way to interrupt one from inside, whereas a
 * worker can simply be terminated. That is how the page stops a runaway
 * validation, and it is stricter than the time limit the server applies to the
 * same work.
 *
 * It is a classic worker, not a module worker. The bundle is a plain script that
 * assigns a global and detects WorkerGlobalScope itself, and importScripts is
 * how it expects to be loaded.
