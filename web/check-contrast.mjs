// Contrast check over the palette in app.src.css. Run with `npm run check:contrast`.
//
// The tokens are copied here rather than parsed out of the CSS, and that costs
// something real: in app.src.css each colour is one light-dark(light, dark) pair,
// and both halves appear again in the two tables below. What it buys is a check
// that runs with no browser, no build and no CSS parser. The duplication also
// fails loudly, because a token edited in one place and not the other shows up as
// a ratio that moved for no reason. Values are OKLCH [L, C, H], converted to sRGB
// and scored by WCAG 2.2.
//
// The targets are 4.5:1 for text (1.4.3), and 3:1 for the boundary of a control
// and for the focus ring (1.4.11). Row hairlines are decorative, so they are only
// checked for being visible at all.
