//   asia-miles-lookup.csv   157 rows, one per (airline, cabin, class group,
//                           fare brand), with six banded Status Points values
//                           packed into one column
//   asia-miles-rules.csv    long/EAV: models, bands, boundaries, the region
//                           rule, the zero-point carriers, the CX city-pair

//
// Two earning models live in these tables, and mixing them up is the mistake most
// likely to be made, so it is worth restating right where the code is:
//
//   * Cathay's own flights earn fixed Status Points per zone, and Asia Miles at
//     exactly a hundred times the points. There are five distance bands, and the
//     second splits in two by region, giving six cards.
//   * Every partner earns fixed Status Points per zone, and Asia Miles as a
//     *percentage of the sector distance*. There are six distance bands, with an
//     extra boundary at 3,700 miles that Cathay's own table does not have.
//
// Applying one model's band set to the other airline group gives a quiet wrong
// answer rather than an error. That is why the scheme travels on every row and is
// asserted below, rather than being worked out at lookup time.

    membership comes from the carrier's published fare groups rather than from
    sampling -- so a class this file does not name is a class no group contains,
    not one nobody happened to observe.

    Scope is the domestic/international test, and only Japan Airlines and Japan
    Transocean use anything but \`all\`. There it decides the answer: JL Economy Y
    is group F at 100% on an international sector and group H at 50% on a
    domestic one, so (airline, cabin, class) is not a key for them.

    The brand is a real axis only on Cathay's own Economy: there the same booking
    classes sit under Flex, Essential and Light with different earn against each,
    so a ticket that names a class and not a family has genuinely bought one of
    three things and the honest answer is the spread. In every other cabin, and on
