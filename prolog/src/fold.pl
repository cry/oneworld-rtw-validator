/** <module> Accent folding for search.

    Typeahead matches a folded copy of both sides, so `sao paulo` finds Sao
    Paulo and `zurich` finds Zurich. Someone looking up an airport types on
    whatever keyboard they have, and a city whose accents they cannot spell is
    exactly the one they need the search for.

    The table below is written out rather than derived from Unicode
    normalisation. NFD plus a combining-mark filter would cover most of it, but
    it comes from an optional package, and it does not decompose the letters
    that are not just an ASCII letter with a mark on top: o-slash, ash, eth,
    thorn, dotless i, l-stroke. Those need a table either way, so there is one
    table rather than a normalisation pass plus a table of exceptions to it.

    test/test_geo.pl checks that this covers every character in the generated
    airport table. Regenerating that table with a new letter in it therefore
    fails the suite, instead of quietly putting a city out of reach of search.
