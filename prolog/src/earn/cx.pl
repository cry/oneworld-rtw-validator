/** <module> Asia Miles, as a kernel plugin.

    This programme is the audit of the interface. It was written second, on
    purpose, against a kernel built around Qantas, to find out what that kernel
    had quietly assumed. It forced exactly one change -- ranges -- and that
    change is written up in PLANS/05 rather than absorbed quietly. It has since
    been rebuilt against a far larger capture without forcing a second change,
    which is the stronger result of the two.

    *Two earning models inside one programme.* Cathay's own flights earn fixed
    Status Points per distance zone, and Asia Miles at exactly a hundred times
    the points. Each of its 25 partners earns fixed Status Points per zone and
    Asia Miles as a *percentage of the distance flown*. The partners also use a
    band set with one more boundary in it, at 3,700 miles, which Cathay's own
    table does not have. Reading a partner against Cathay's bands returns a
    plausible number from the wrong row on every sector between 2,751 and 5,000
    miles. So the scheme travels with the airline and is an argument to every
    zone fact, rather than an assumption buried somewhere.

    That is also why accrual/5 returns an expression rather than a number:
    `fixed(70)` and `pct(125)` reach the reader down one path. This is not a
    guess about some future third programme. It is two halves of the second one.

    *The marketing carrier picks the table, and the operator picks the card.* A
    QF flight number flown on an Emirates aircraft reads the QF rows. A CX flight
    number, though, is priced two different ways. On Cathay metal, Economy splits
    into Flex, Essential and Light. On a partner's metal it earns the Codeshare
    card instead, which matches Economy Light exactly in every band, and which
    Premium Economy, Business and First do not have at all. So a codeshare in a
    premium cabin comes back unknown rather than quietly priced off the
    Cathay-operated figure, and a Cathay flight number with no operator named
    cannot be answered at all.

    *Three ways to have no answer, and none of them is a zero.* A class in no
    fare group is refused outright and never priced off a neighbouring class,
    because within one cabin the rates differ by up to three times: Japan
    Airlines' Business group B is 125% and its group G is 70%. A distance band
    nobody sampled carries no Status Points rate at all, so the kernel reports it
    undecided beside a mileage figure that is known, and the zone label says which
    airline was sampled where. And two fare groups exist in their carriers'
    definitions with no rate at any distance and no percentage either, which is
    said in exactly those terms. Set against all three, nine carriers earn a
    real, measured zero -- they are exactly the non-oneworld partners -- and that
    is printed as the 0 it is.

    *The fare group is the unit, not the booking class.* Every class in a group
    earns the same, and the membership comes from each carrier's published fare
    groups rather than from the sampling. That matters because the earlier
    capture derived membership from the calculator's one representative class per
    group, and the representative is sometimes not a member of the group it
    names. It invented classes and dropped real ones on two airlines. Two
    airlines also price the same class differently depending on whether the
    sector stays inside one country, so (airline, cabin, class) is not a key --
    see prefer_scope/3.

    *The bucket stayed opaque, and the basis did the work.* American is the one
    airline whose mile percentage varies: 150% where both airports are in the
    same country and 125% otherwise. That is a fact about the sector rather than
    about the fare, and it reached the accrual as part of the route basis without
    widening the protocol -- which is what the resolvers-take-the-segment rule in
    the kernel was for.

    The one thing this programme did force, and still does. Cathay lists the same
    economy booking classes -- Y,B,H,K, then M,L,V, then S,N,Q,O -- under Flex,
    Essential *and* Light, with different earn against each. A ticket in K on an
    ultra-short sector earns 25 Status Points as Flex, 15 as Essential and 10 as
    Light. So the class does not imply the card and there is nothing to derive
    one from: an itinerary that gives a class and no `fareFamily` has genuinely
    bought one of three things. Refusing to answer would be useless and picking
    one would be a guess wearing the same clothes as an answer, so the bucket
    comes back as `one_of/2` and the kernel prices every candidate and reports
    the spread.

    That is confined to Cathay's own Economy, and to part of it. Y is full-fare
    and therefore the flexible fare whatever the grid lists it under -- the one
    place in either programme where a fact that is not on the page decides an
    answer, which is why it is a predicate of its own, cx_class_settled/3,
    carrying its reason into the register. B, H and K are not settled that way
    and stay a range. Everywhere else -- every other Cathay cabin, and every
    partner in every cabin -- a class picks its card out on its own.
