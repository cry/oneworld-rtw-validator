/** <module> What a routing earns: sequencing, totals and the earn register.

    Nothing in this file names a programme. A programme is a module that supplies
    multifile clauses of the protocol below. The kernel decides only three
    things: the order those clauses are asked in, what an unanswered question
    means, and how the answers add up.

    That is the whole design. Qantas and Cathay disagree at nearly every join --
    region pairs against distance zones, an earn category against a cabin and a
    fare family, fixed integers against a share of the miles flown, a tier bonus
    on one currency but not the other. So what they share is the pipeline, not
    the lookup. If a table lookup were the interface, Cathay would be a special
    case inside it, and a third programme would mean a rewrite.

    The protocol:

        earn_program(Id, DisplayName, ProvenanceKey)
        currency(Id, CurrencyKey, DisplayName, Opts)
        fare_family(Id, Family)
        eligible(Id, Segment, Annotated, Outcome)
        fare_bucket(Id, Segment, Annotated, Bucket, Basis)
        route_basis(Id, Segment, Annotated, Distance, Basis)
        accrual(Id, Bucket, Basis, Carrier, Rates)
        tier(Id, Tier, DisplayName)
        bonus(Id, Tier, Segment, CurrencyKey, BaseAmount, BonusAmount)
        program_source(Id, Table, Source)
        program_note(Id, Note)

    Four properties hold it together, and all four have to be kept.

    *A bucket is opaque.* Qantas binds category(business); Cathay binds
    fare(qf, business, business, cdij). The kernel only ever hands a bucket back
    to the same programme's accrual/5. So a programme whose bucket comes from
    somewhere this file has never heard of needs no change here.

    Like eligible/4, fare_bucket/5 is handed the whole annotated itinerary as
    well as the segment, because a bucket can turn on something the segment does
    not carry. The fare's cabin is the obvious example, and it is what lets a
    programme fall back on the class the tariff says the fare is sold in when the
    itinerary did not say.

    *No resolver gets less than the segment and the annotation.* The plan this
    was built from gave each resolver its own signature -- a distance here, a
    pair of airports there -- and every one of them proved too narrow within two
    programmes. A Cathay zone needs the endpoints. A fare bucket needs the cabin.
    A route basis needs the marketing carrier, because Qantas publishes one table
    for its own flights and another for its partners'. A tier bonus needs the
    segment, because it is a benefit of flying an airline rather than of holding
    a card. Guessing which facts a resolver will want is what went wrong; handing
    every one of them the same two things is what stopped it.

    That choice has since paid off again without needing a change. American's
    Asia Miles Business rate is 150% within one country and 125% between two,
    which is a fact about the sector rather than about the fare, and
    route_basis/5 carried it into the accrual because it had the segment to read
    it off.

    *An accrual returns an expression, not a number.* See src/earn/expr.pl. Fixed
    rates and proportional ones then share one path, which Cathay needs inside a
    single programme.

    *A currency declares its own rules.* "Status Points take no tier bonus" is
    bonus_applies(false) in the programme's data, never a conditional here.

    bonus/6 takes the segment as well as the tier, because a bonus can be a
    benefit of flying one airline rather than of holding a card. Qantas pays its
    status bonus on Qantas-marketed sectors and not on partner ones, so the same
    journey carries a bonus on one sector and none on the next.

    Undecidability spreads rather than collapsing. A segment the programme cannot
    price does not earn zero. It earns `indeterminate`, the journey total is
    marked a lower bound, and every renderer has to say so. That is the same
    standard the validator holds itself to, and it matters more here because a
    number is so much easier to believe than a verdict.
