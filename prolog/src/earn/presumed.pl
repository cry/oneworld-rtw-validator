/** <module> The class an Explorer fare is sold in, when the itinerary did not say.

    An itinerary that names a cabin has said more than it looks like it has.
    Section 5(b) publishes, for each carrier, the class an Explorer fare books
    into in each cabin, so "business on CX" is `D` rather than a question. Every
    earning table is read against a class. Without this file, an itinerary
    written as a routing could not be priced in either programme, which is a
    worse answer than the one the tariff already contains.

    Four things about it are on purpose.

    *Only the applicable codes.* 5(b)'s notes also allow a lower cabin's own
    code, `Y` on a First fare, and `B` or `H` on a DONE Business fare. But every
    one of those turns on what the *flight* offers, which an itinerary cannot
    show. Presuming one of them would be guessing at a seat map. Presuming the
    applicable code is reading the fare.

    *The fare basis narrows it further, and has to.* 5(b) publishes two business
    columns, headed "Business — DONE*" and "Business — IONE3". Those are fare
    bases, not cabins: a DONE4 fare books into the DONE column, and the IONE3
    column describes a fare this itinerary is not. Asking for the cabin's columns
    instead returns both codes, `D` and `I` on most carriers, and on Qantas' own
    earning table those two sit in *different* categories: Business and Discount
    Business. The result was a sector reported undecided over an ambiguity the
    fare basis at the top of the same report had already settled. So the basis
    picks the column, and the cabin's wider projection stands in only where the
    itinerary has no published basis at all.

    *Economy comes out as `L`, not `Y`.* `Y` is the usual shorthand for an
    economy cabin, and it is not what this fare books into: 5(b) puts an economy
    Explorer fare in `L` on every carrier that publishes a row. The difference is
    not cosmetic. On Cathay metal `L` is the M,L,V group and `Y` is the top one,
    and on the Qantas table `L` is Discount Economy where `Y` is Flexible
    Economy. Presuming `Y` would therefore overstate the earn by roughly double,
    and too high is the bad direction for an estimate to be wrong in.

    *It never reaches rule 5(b).* That rule checks the class that was booked, and
    a presumed class would let it report a pass it never checked. This is the
    earning side reading the tariff to fill a gap in an estimate, which is not
    the same as a validator inventing evidence. The rule keeps the cabin's
    projection for the same reason: a ticket presented in either business column
    is booked in a code 5(b) names, whatever basis this validator reports.
