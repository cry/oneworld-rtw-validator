/** <module> Accrual expressions.

    A programme's accrual table binds a rate rather than a number. That way a
    table of fixed integers and a table of "a percentage of flown miles" reach
    the reader down one path instead of two. Cathay needs both *inside one
    programme*: its own metal earns from a table, and its partners earn a share
    of the miles flown. So this is not a guess about some future third
    programme. It is the second one.

        fixed(N)          N, whatever the distance
        pct(P)            P per cent of the distance flown
        max(A, B)         the larger of two rates, which is how a
        min(A, B)         minimum or a cap is written
        sum([A, B, ...])  several rates added
        none              this row earns nothing of this currency, which is a
                          different thing from earning zero of it and a
                          different thing again from not being priced at all

    `none` is the one worth dwelling on. A Qantas region row can publish points
    and a dash under Status Credits, meaning the carrier serving that pair earns
    no status currency at all. Writing that as 0 would add up correctly and read
    wrongly. A total of "0 Status Credits" over a journey made of such sectors
    is true, and the reader is owed the reason for it.

    Nothing here knows about a programme, a carrier or a currency. It knows
    about a rate, a distance and a rounding rule.

%! rounding(?Name, ?Goal) is nondet.
%  How a currency's amounts come off a fraction. Each programme declares this
%  per currency, because the programmes disagree. A percentage accrual has to
%  land on an integer, and which way it lands is the airline's choice, not ours.
rounding(nearest, round).
rounding(down,    floor).
rounding(up,      ceiling).

%! expr_shape(?Shape) is nondet.
%  The name of every form eval/4 accepts. It is exported so the conformance
%  harness can assert that a programme's tables contain nothing else. Otherwise
%  a typo in a rate would fail at the first request that reached that row,
%  rather than at the build.

%  Rounding is applied once, at the end, rather than at each step. Rounding the
%  arms of a max/2 separately and then comparing them can pick the smaller of
%  the two true values, and a sum of rounded parts is not the rounded sum.
