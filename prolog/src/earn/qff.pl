/** <module> Qantas Frequent Flyer, as a kernel plugin.

    Resolvers only. Every number lives in data/earn/qff/, every decision about
    sequencing lives in kernel.pl, and this file joins the two.

    There are three route bases, in the order the published table means them to
    be read: the named region pairs; then Intra-USA Short Haul, a region group
    that is itself banded on distance; then the "All other flights" mileage
    bands. The third is the fallback, and the second is why route_basis/5
    returns an opaque basis rather than "a region pair, else a band".

    Two things about the categories are worth reading before the code.

    *A category depends on the route as well as the class.* Five carriers
    publish different class-to-category rows for different parts of their
    network: Fiji Airways inside Fiji, Japan Airlines inside Japan, Malaysia on
    its long-haul markets, SriLankan on named routes, and Qantas between its own
    domestic and international networks. Three of those depend only on the
    endpoints, and are settled here. Malaysia's and SriLankan's are not, and
    cannot be from the tables in this repository. They are scoped to
    "Australia", "the UK" and "the Middle East", which the earning-table region
    page never defines, and inventing definitions would mean a fifth geography
    taxonomy, made up rather than read. Where a class falls in the same category
    on both candidate rows, the answer is the same either way and is given.
    Where it does not, the segment is undecided and says which two categories it
    sits between, which claims less and helps more than picking one.

    *A published row can be empty.* Japan Airlines' within-Japan row says points
    are awarded on information Japan Airlines provides, and never tabulates
    them. That is not the same as earning nothing. It reaches the reader as
    undecided, carrying the table's own words.
