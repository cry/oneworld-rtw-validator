% ocean is permitted" (4a), "travel must be in a continuous forward direction
% between TC1 - TC2 - TC3" (4b), and "must terminate at the same point" (4c).
% They are not three independent facts. Together they force the collapsed

% the message can name the actual defect instead of quoting a count of ocean
% crossings. Backtracking *within* a continent, which 4(b) expressly allows,
% vanishes in the collapse and is never seen here.
