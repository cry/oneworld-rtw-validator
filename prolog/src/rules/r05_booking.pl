/** <module> Rule 5(b) -- booking codes.

    Section 5(b) publishes, for each carrier, the class an Explorer fare books
    into in each cabin. A ticket sold in any other code is not this fare.

    The rule can only be checked when the itinerary says what class it was sold
    in, and that field is optional. A missing class is *not* `indeterminate`, on
    purpose. An itinerary written as a routing has nowhere to put a booking code
    at all, and treating a fare notation as an incomplete segment table would
    make every routing undecidable over a field the notation cannot express. So
    the register says instead that there was no code to read -- see the chk_na at
    the foot of this file. As soon as one segment names a class, every segment
    that names one is measured.

    There are three outcomes, because 5(b) has three kinds of class in it:

      * the applicable code for the cabin -- ok;
      * a code the notes allow only in a stated case -- also ok, and recorded in
        the register along with the case it leans on;
      * anything else -- an error.

    The second used to be a warning, and should not be. "For flights where First
    or Business Class is not offered or available, passengers may travel in a
    lower class, in the applicable booking code for that lower class" is a
    permission the tariff grants, and a ticket sold under it is a correct ticket.
    The condition is about what the *flight* offers, which means a seat map, and
    no itinerary carries one. But it is also a condition the airline's own
    inventory settled at the moment of sale: the code is in the itinerary
    because a seat in it was sold. There is nothing here for a traveller to fix,
    and a warning nobody can act on only gets in the way of the ones they can.

    The case is still worth stating, so it is stated where statements of fact
    belong: the check register names the segments and the note they rely on. The
    outcome of the check does not change, which is the point.
