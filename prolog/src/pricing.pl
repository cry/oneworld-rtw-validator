%  Section 0: "Travel between South West Pacific and Europe/Middle East on a
%  single flight number or by surface ... is considered travelling via Asia.
%  Continents South West Pacific, Asia and Europe/Middle East must each be

%  itinerary never touches an Asian airport.

%! via_asia_sector(+A, -SegmentNumber) is nondet.
%  One segment, flight or surface, that joins the South West Pacific straight to

%
%  This feeds the continent count and nothing else. It stays out of 4(e) on
%  purpose, even though "considered travelling via Asia" could be read as adding
%  an arrival into Asia and a departure from it to the itinerary. Some
%  experienced bookers do read it that way.
%
%  Two things keep it here. First, the sentence sits in section 0, under how the
%  fare is determined, and what it says must be counted is continents -- the
%  input to the fare basis, which is the paragraph just above it. Second, the
%  other reading barely does anything. The implied pair would use up one of
%  Asia's two allowed arrivals and one of its two departures, so it only ever
%  bites an itinerary that already enters Asia twice by air *and* flies a nonstop
%  between the South West Pacific and Europe. That predicts a traveller who has
%  flown LON-SYD through and never hit an Asia problem, which is what we see. The
%  one itinerary on record of the biting shape is already invalid five other
%  ways. Adopting the other reading would therefore have changed no verdict
%  anyone has produced, while adding a new way to fail for journeys that price
%  today.
