/** <module> Annotated itinerary -> fare-construction routing string.

    The inverse of io/route_in.pl. It lives here rather than in the browser for
    one reason: a routing written in JavaScript would be a second definition of
    the grammar, and the only one nothing tests. With both directions in Prolog,
    the round trip becomes a property the suite can assert -- parse a routing,
    annotate it, write it out again, and get the same string back.

    It works from the *annotated* itinerary rather than the raw one, because the
    notation records what each point counts as, and that is a conclusion rather
    than an input. A point declared `X/` and a point worked out to be a transfer
    from a two-hour connection both come out as `X/`. The routing describes how
    the itinerary was classified, which is exactly what makes it round-trip to
    the same verdict.

    Four things do not survive the trip. All of them are limits of the notation
    rather than of this module:

      * A city code becomes its airport on the way in and stays an airport on
        the way out, so `LON-BA-NYC` comes back as `LHR-BA-JFK`. That is
        canonicalisation, not loss: both name the same journey.
      * A routing carries one carrier per leg. A codeshare with different
        marketing and operating carriers keeps only the marketing one, which is
        the one 4(j) is written against.
      * A three-letter carrier designator that is also a place code cannot be
        written at all -- see route_ambiguous_carrier/2. HAC is the only one in
        the 4(j) table, and it is Hachijojima as well as Hokkaido Air System.
      * Dates and times have no notation at all. Writing out a dated itinerary
        gives a routing that answers every rule except 6 and 7.

    A point that is neither a transfer nor a stopover -- no ground time and no
    declaration -- cannot be written down either. Every non-final point in a
    routing is one or the other, and a bare code means stopover. Rather than
    quietly promoting such points to stopovers, and so changing what the
    itinerary means, annotated_route/2 fails and route_undecidable/2 names the
    segments.

% "annotated_route/2 failed" is not an answer anyone can act on, so the two

% in whichever front end noticed, because there are now two front ends -- the
% HTTP server, and the browser running this same code compiled to WebAssembly.
% A message kept in one of them would drift from the other, and the wrong
% message sends the reader off to fix a point that is not the problem.
