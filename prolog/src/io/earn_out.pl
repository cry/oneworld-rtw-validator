/** <module> Earn report -> JSON dict.

    The kernel already builds dicts, so this is nearly a pass-through. It exists
    for the one thing that is not. An amount can be `none` or `indeterminate`,
    and neither may reach a JSON consumer as a number.

    Both become `null`, and `known` says which of the two it was. A client that
    renders `value` and ignores `known` then prints a blank rather than a zero.
    That is the failure this shape is chosen to make impossible: a `0` in a
    points column is a claim, and it is the wrong claim in both cases.
