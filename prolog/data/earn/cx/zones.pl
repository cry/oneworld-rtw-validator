/** <module> The two distance-zone schemes. GENERATED -- do not edit.

    Built by prolog/tools/build_cx_tables.mjs from
    data/earn/sources/asia-miles-lookup.csv and asia-miles-rules.csv,
    snapshot 2026-08-11 of

    See data/earn/sources/asia-miles-parsing-guide.md for what the columns mean
    and how the figures were obtained.

    Six positions each, and position 3 is where they part company: on a partner
    it is a distance band of its own, 2,751 to 3,700 miles, and on Cathay it is
    the region variant of band 2 at the same 751 to 2,750 miles as position 2.
    A sector between 2,751 and 5,000 miles read against the wrong scheme returns
    a plausible number from the wrong row, which is why the scheme is an argument
    here and not an assumption anywhere.

    The fourth geography taxonomy in this repository, and independent of the
    other three: it is a seven-country list and a distance, where the fare rule,
    OurAirports and the Qantas earning regions each cut the world somewhere
    else.
