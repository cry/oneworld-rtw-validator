# Fetched earning tables

Raw captures of the two programmes' published earning tables, taken on the date each file records.
The Qantas ones were read out of the pages' own DOM, or transcribed by hand. The Asia Miles ones came
from the calculator's own API, which is why they arrive as CSV with a guide beside them rather than
as a transcription of a grid.

These files are the input to the generators under `prolog/tools/`, which turn them into the `.pl`
fact files the kernel reads. Both the capture and the generated file are committed, so an upstream
change arrives as a reviewable diff.

They are kept because the earning tables have no version and no clause numbers to cite, unlike the
fare rule, which has both. A URL and a fetch date are all the provenance there is, so they travel
with the numbers into `program_source/3` and into every earn report. See
[`PLANS/05-loyalty-earning.md`](../../../../PLANS/05-loyalty-earning.md).

| File | Table | Read from |
|---|---|---|
| `qff-categories.json` | carrier and RBD to Qantas Frequent Flyer earn category | the Qantas earn-category tables |
| `qff-regions.json` | region-pair rows, partner-marketed | the Qantas partner airline earning tables |
| `qff-bands.json` | the "All other flights" mileage bands | the same page |
| `qff-metal.json` | Qantas' own table: region pairs, Australian domestic bands and mileage bands, over ten earn categories | the Qantas and Jetstar earning tables |
| `qff-tiers.json` | the Qantas status bonus by tier | the Qantas earning-points page |
| `asia-miles-lookup.csv` | 157 cards over 26 airlines: cabin, class group and fare brand to six banded Status Points values and a miles rule | the Cathay miles calculator's API |
| `asia-miles-rules.csv` | the two band schemes, boundary reliability, the enhanced-region rule, the nine zero-point carriers, four city-pair overrides, per-airline sampling coverage | the same |
| `asia-miles-parsing-guide.md` | what the two CSVs mean and how they were obtained, captured verbatim | written against the sampling run |

One table is **not** here and the programme that needs it cannot be finished without it:

* **Cathay's membership tiers**, and the bonus each one pays.

One of the 25 partners has no fare group containing a code that section 5(b) books an Explorer fare
into. `MH` files neither `I` nor `L`, so a Malaysian sector on an IONE3 business fare, or on any
economy fare, cannot be priced. `prolog/test/test_earn.pl` asserts that exactly, so a second carrier
appearing is a regression, and this one disappearing means Malaysia's groups grew.

It was three carriers under the v2 capture, which derived class lists from the calculator's one
representative class per group. `JL` and `NU` appeared to be missing `D` and `L`, and both were
artefacts of that method rather than facts about the airlines. v3 takes the membership from each
carrier's published fare groups instead, so a class the table does not name is now a real absence.
That is why the resolver refuses it rather than hedging.

Cathay partner earn used to be the other missing table. It is served by the calculator rather than
published as a grid, and the two CSVs above are that calculator's own responses: 26,780 of them over
1,752 city pairs. That is why they carry a sampling-coverage table, and why a band nobody sampled
reaches the report as undecided rather than as a number. Cathay's own rows were enumerated in full;
the partners were sampled at 23 to 90 pairs each.

Two of these files were transcribed by hand rather than read out of the page, and each says so in its
own `via` field: `qff-metal.json` and `qff-tiers.json`. The Qantas site refused the scraper on both
pages. That is worth knowing when checking a figure, which is why the note travels into the report
rather than staying here.
