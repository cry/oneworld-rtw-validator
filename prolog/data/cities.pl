/** <module> IATA metropolitan city codes.

    Fare construction is written in city codes, not airport codes. A routing
    reads `NYC-X/LON-SIN`, never `JFK-X/LHR-SIN`. The airport table has no such
    codes, because OurAirports lists airports, so this table maps each
    multi-airport city onto a representative airport.

    The table runs in both directions, and both are load-bearing.

    Forward, `city_code/2` picks a representative airport so a routing written
    `NYC-X/LON-SIN` resolves to airports before anything else sees it.

    Backward, `city_of/2` says which metropolitan area an airport belongs to.
    That is what 4(i) is written in -- "the same city pairs / sectors cannot be
    flown more than once in the same direction" -- and what 4(c) and 4(d) mean
    by a point. Without it, LHR and LGW are two places. Then LON-NYC flown out of
    Heathrow and back into Gatwick is not a repeat, an itinerary routed via its
    own origin city is not via the point of origin, and a journey that ends
    across town from where it started looks like it ended somewhere else.

    Only airports in the generated table belong here. test/test_route.pl checks
    that every entry resolves, so a regenerated airport table that drops an
    airport fails the suite rather than turning a city code into "unknown
    airport" at runtime. Kyiv (IEV) is missing for exactly that reason: KBP
    currently has no scheduled service.
    Airports marketed under a city's name but held by IATA as their own city are
    also absent. Paris Beauvais (BVA), Westchester (HPN) and Kitchener/Waterloo
    (YKF) are not members here, because grouping a place the fare rule keeps
    separate invents violations, and that is the more expensive way to be wrong.
