/** <module> Qantas Frequent Flyer earning, against hand-computed values.

    Conformance in test/earn/conformance.pl asserts the shape of a programme.
    This file asserts the numbers, which is the part conformance cannot. Every
    expected value below was read out of the published table by hand, and the
    comment above it names the row it came from.

    The mutation tests follow the same idea as the rule suite's: change exactly
    one field and assert that exactly one thing moves. A category table is a
    large flat mapping, and the way it goes wrong is a letter landing in the
    wrong column. A total would absorb that; a per-segment assertion catches it.
