    The mutation suite is the most valuable one here. Each fixture is the
    lhr_classic golden with exactly one rule broken, and each test asserts that
    exactly the expected rule ids fire. That catches two things at once: rules
    that miss a real violation, and rules that fire on legal itineraries. It is
    also what shows the rules are independent of each other.
