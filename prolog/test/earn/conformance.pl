/** <module> Every registered earning programme must pass this.

    This is what makes a third programme cheap to add. Adding one means a
    resolver module, a directory of tables and a directory of fixtures. If
    conformance passes, it is wired up correctly, and nothing in this file had
    to learn its name.

    Two of the assertions below are worth more than the rest, and the others are
    here to keep them company:

      * a bucket every accrual can price, and an accrual for every bucket. A
        table with a row nothing can reach is a transcription error nobody would
        notice. A bucket with no row is a request that comes back
        `indeterminate` for a reason the reader will assume is their fault.
      * indeterminate is never rendered as zero. Every currency of every
        programme has to survive an unnamed operating carrier as an undecided
        answer.

    The register-coverage test in test_rules.pl is this file's counterpart on the
    validation side, and it exists for the same reason: a number nobody can trace
    back to a row is worse than no number.
