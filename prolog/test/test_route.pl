/** <module> Routing strings, declared stop kinds and routing mode.

    Three things are asserted here, most valuable first:

    1. A routing string and a segment array describing the same journey must
       produce the same verdict. That is what makes the routing form a real
       second front end rather than a separate, weaker validator.
    2. Declared stop kinds must settle rule 8 on their own, with no timestamps
       anywhere. Otherwise routing mode would report `indeterminate` for every
       itinerary and be useless.
    3. Routing mode must not quietly pass the rules it cannot check. Rules 6 and
       7 have to appear in the report's not-checked list.
